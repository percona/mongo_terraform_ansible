# Deploy MongoDB clusters using Ansible
## Quick guide
1. Prepare an `inventory` file (or use one generated by Terraform)
2. Edit the [groups_vars/all](group_vars/all) variables file to choose the options, passwords, ports, etc.
3. Run the `main.yml` playbook pointing Ansible to the desired inventory file. For example:
```
cd ./ansible
ansible-playbook main.yml -i ../inventory
```

The installation process takes around 15 min for a 2 shard cluster

## Inventory file

- Keep a separate inventory file per environment (for example dev, test, prod).
- If you have more than one cluster per environment, then keep one inventory per cluster as well (for example devrs1, devrs2, devshard1, devshard2).
- On each inventory file, we have to specify groups for each shard's replicaset (name them `shardXXXX`), as well as the config servers (name it `cfg`) and mongos routers (name it `mongos`).
- For each standalone replicaset you should name them `rsXXXX` (don't use `shardXXXX` for replica sets not part of a sharded cluster).
- You can specify a server in more than one group only for the case of deploying a mongos + config server on the same host. Any other combinations are currently not supported and cause execution to fail.

- Example of an inventory for a sharded cluster:
```
[cfg]
dev-mongo-cfg00 mongodb_primary=True
dev-mongo-cfg01
dev-mongo-cfg02

[shard0]
dev-mongo-shard00svr0 mongodb_primary=True
dev-mongo-shard00svr1
dev-mongo-shard00svr2
[shard1]
dev-mongo-shard01svr0 mongodb_primary=True
dev-mongo-shard01svr1
dev-mongo-shard01svr2

[mongos]
dev-mongo-router00

[pmm]
dev-percona-pmm

[all:vars]
ansible_ssh_user=mongodb
pmm_public_ip=30.30.30.30
pmm_private_ip=192.168.0.1
bucket=dev-mongo-backups
region=NORTHAMERICA-NORTHEAST1
cluster=dev
access_key_id=GOOG1E2TPIJ5*****
secret_access_key=******
```

- Example of an inventory for a single replicaset:
```
[rs1]
host11 mongodb_primary=True
host12
host13

[pmm]
test-percona-pmm

[all:vars]
ansible_ssh_user=mongodb
pmm_public_ip=30.30.30.30
pmm_private_ip=192.168.0.1
bucket=test-mongo-backups
region=NORTHAMERICA-NORTHEAST1
cluster=test
access_key_id=GOOG1E2TPI*******
secret_access_key=******
```

The `mongodb_primary` tag will make that server become the primary by giving it higher priority in the replicaset configuration.
Only 1 sharded cluster per inventory file is supported at this time. If you have more use separate inventory files (See above).

## Configuration
* The [all variables file](group_vars/all) contains all the user-modifiable parameters. Each of these come with a small description to clarify the purpose, unless it is self-explanatory.
You should review and modify this file before making the deployment.

Note: PMM user and password are used to login to PMM UI via the web browser. If you intend to change the PMM credentials on the variables file (defaults are admin/admin), you will need to login to PMM via the web browser and change the PMM password there first, otherwise the playbook will fail.

## Running
* The playbook is meant to handle a deployment from scratch, unless run with some specific tags. Be extra careful if you are running it against servers that already have data.

* Deploy a replica set or sharded cluster from scratch:
```
ansible-playbook main.yml -i inventory
```
* Add a new shard (e.g. shard3) to an existing cluster:
```
ansible-playbook main.yml -i inventory --limit shard3
```
* Deploy skip the monitoring and backup parts
```
ansible-playbook main.yml -i inventory --skip-tags monitoring,backup
```

### Available tags:
  - os_conf
    - Tunes the OS for MongoDB
  - install
    - Installs packages at the OS level
  - mongo_cfgsrv
    - Configures the config servers
  - mongo_rs
    - Configures the replica sets
  - bootstrap_rs
    - Bootstraps the replica sets (rs.initiate())
  - mongos
    - Configures the mongos routers
  - add_shards
    - Runs the sh.addShard() command on a mongos router
  - backup
    - Deploys & configures the pbm agent    
  - pmm_server
    - Deploys a pmm2 server with docker
  - monitoring
    - Deploys pmm2 client and registers with a pmm server

## Cleanup
* If you want cleanup a failed deploy, usually stopping mongod/mongos components and removing the datadir content is enough e.g.
```
service mongos stop; service mongod stop; rm -rf /var/lib/mongo/*
```

You can also try running the `reset.yml` playbook:
```
ansible-playbook reset.yml -i inventory
```

## Restarting
* To restart all mongod, mongos and pbm-agent services you can run the `restart.yml` playbook:
```
ansible-playbook restart.yml -i inventory
```

This is useful for example after restoring a physical backup. The playbook includes a resync of PBM backup inventory at the end. 

## Connecting
* Connection string example with TLS
```
mongo --tls --tlsCAFile /tmp/test-ca.pem --tlsCertificateKeyFile /tmp/test-client.pem --port 27017 --host ip-10-0-1-199.ec2.internal -u root -p percona
```
* Listing existing backups with TLS
```
pbm list --mongodb-uri "mongodb://pbm:secretpwd@ip-10-0-1-199.ec2.internal:27019/?tls=true&tlsCertificateKeyFile=/tmp/test-server.pem&tlsCAFile=/tmp/test-ca.pem"
```
