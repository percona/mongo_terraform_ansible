# Deploy hardware for MongoDB clusters using Terraform in AWS

## Pre-requisites

1. Install [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)
2. Authenticate your shell session with your AWS account IAM credentials

    ```
    aws configure
    ``` 

3. Upload your SSH key to AWS platform
   
    Login to [AWS console](aws.amazon.com), go to `EC2` -> `Network & Security` -> `Key Pairs`. Select the `Actions`  buttion and click the `Import key pair` button. Upload your public SSH key and write down the associated username. This user and key will be used to login to the instances created.

4. Clone this repository on your machine and `cd` to it

    ```
    cd mongo_terraform_ansible/terraform/aws
    ```

5. Initialize Terraform 

    ```
    terraform init
    ```

## Quick guide

1. Prepare the configuration file

    ```
    vi variables.tf
    ```

2. Run Terraform to create resources

    ```
    terraform apply
    ``` 

3. Add the SSH configuration file generated by Terraform to your machine to connect easily. For example: 

    ```
    cat ssh_config >> ~/.ssh/config
    ```

    Modify the config as needed depending on your environment

- Look inside the [ansible](ansible) folder for instructions to complete the deployment of a complete MongoDB cluster

- The deployment of the resources required for a 2 shard cluster with Terraform takes around 1 minute

- You can run `terraform output -json` to see the access/secret keys generated for the S3 bucket created to store backups

## Minimum variables to customize

These are the ones you have to care about for a quick deploy with default values:

- env_tag

    This is just a prefix for the name of your environment. Make sure nobody else is using the same one in the project

- aws_ssh_users

    List of SSH usernames and path to their public keys to configure access to your instances

- my_ssh_user

    Your own SSH user. This is used to generate an SSH config file for you

- enable_ssh_gateway

    Wether you can SSH directly or through a jump host. This is used to generate an SSH config file for you
